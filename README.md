# Rust Sandbox

My code as I follow along with [Rust Crash Course | Rustlang by Traversy
Media](https://youtu.be/zF34dRivLOw). I made some changes along the way to help
myself better understand the concepts.

To run a module, open `main.rs`, comment out `mod x` and `x::run();` for the
currently active module, then uncomment `mod y` and `y::run();` for the module
you want to run.
